# Complex numbers implementation in Python

## In few words

I created this project solely to learn how to work with Git and to train OOP in python. It allows to do some basic arithmetic using complex numbers, convert the cardinal(if that's the name) form to Trig and Euler forms. It contains also some usefull(hopefully) methods. I hope I can convert this funny code into working module in the future :)
